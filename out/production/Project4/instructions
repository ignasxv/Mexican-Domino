At each turn, a player can play their domino
on their train, the Mexican train, or any other
player's train if that train is "open". By default,
all trains are "closed" so the players can only play
on their train or the Mexican train.

If a player cannot play any domino because they hand
does not have a domino that matches the end domino of
any train they can play, then their train is marked as
"open", and they draw a domino from the remaining pile.
If they can play that domino, they may do so, but if not
then it goes in their hand and their turn is over.
